		I am a father of four, and married to my wife and true love since 1996.  Thereafter, my life has two paths...
	</p>
	<p>	
		By profession I am a software technologist, a 1997 C.S. graduate from UNM, running my own software consultancy 
	 	since 2006.  
		I have had technical oversight of thousands of engineers, leading both small teams and large organizations to 
		success.  Even as a consultant, I have served as CTO in several organizations.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a spiritual background, I was originally Catholic.  Though having gone my own way from Catholicism, starting from 
		somewhere between 2007 through 2015 depending on how my story is reckoned, I still hold great admiration for both
		Christianity/Catholicism and the power of its message.  Ironically, since then, I feel my respect for Christ has simply 
		continued to grow.  Perhaps to oversimplify, I "left" because it was time for me to begin my own personal "journey
		in the desert" - a transformation into who I really am, and likewise a discovery of the legacy I intend to create.
	</p>
	<p>
		In gratitude of my many blessings, including the terrible challenges I've faced and overcome, I made spiritual
		awakening and spirit-aligned community my present-day passion.  This new journey has included a variety of 
		self-transformational steps:
		I am a graduate of PSI seminars. I founded a "Men's Council", where men sharpen themselves. I have received the 
		blessings of plant-medicine (viz. psychadelics) and animal-medicine (viz. Kambo) ceremonies.  I have started on the 
		path of becoming a musician.  Also, together with my wife, I had sold all that I owned along with my
		Arizona home, and moved my family to Mexico City - arriving with only suitcases - despite having never been to 
		Mexico previously in my life.  All has become new, and full of wonder, as I step into this new phase.
	</p>
	<p>
		My adventure has only just begun.  And I am, and remain, open to all that the divine leads me to.  I want you, reader,
		to come with me.  That we may...awaken together.
